root_path will take you to a page with a couple of forms that will allow you to test the app.

The top form takes an email address and URL. When submitted it creates a short URL that is returned as JSON.

The bottom form takes the short URL and returns the corresponding email address and original URL as JSON.

The urls/ page lists the short URLs and the original URLS. Clicking on the short URL links will redirect you to the original URL.

If the email address or original URL fails validation, descriptive error messages will be returned as JSON with an HTTP status of 422.
